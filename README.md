# Week 14: Tech Blog ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This week's assignment tasked us with making a blog for users to create accounts and post/comment their thoughts (obviously for tech-related topics).
This assignment definitely felt like a culmination of nearly everything we've learned this whole bootcamp; I was startled for a moment when I realized I had to drudge up my memory of HTML and CSS. But overall, working with/by the MVC model has been eye-opening: learning to compartmentalize my codebases by their appropriate role has done wonders for organization, but I am still a struggling a tad with the sheer amount of files. Having to keep track of what data is generated by what file and sent to what route has had my head spinning a bit.

Seeing the size of the repos from 12-13 weeks back and comparing it to the ones we're managing now is both a little daunting and promising.

Code-wise, being able to actually produce an app similar to what would be published in the public domain has been fun, and a good first taste of "real-world" coding.
